👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, software engineering, and working with modern technologies. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and diving into the latest trends in tech.

🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript and React, and exploring advanced concepts in Python, iOS development, and large language models. I’m also focused on improving my skills in full-stack development and cloud technologies.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving React, Node.js, TypeScript, Python, and cloud services. I’m particularly interested in opportunities that leverage my experience in both front-end and back-end development, as well as those involving innovative solutions and cutting-edge technologies.
